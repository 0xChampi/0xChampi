I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer üíª and Designer üé®!
</h2> 

As a dynamic Full-Stack Developer with a unique blend of over 20 years of experience in software engineering, an academic background in Physics, and a profound talent in UI/UX design, I present a rare combination of skills that bridge the gap between technical precision and aesthetic brilliance. This distinctive mix positions me as an exceptional asset in the tech industry, capable of navigating both Web2 and Web3 environments with equal proficiency.

My technical acumen covers a broad spectrum of technologies and frameworks, including NextJS, Tailwind, Typescript, MongoDB, Wagmi, GQL, Vercel, and IntelliJ. This allows me to adeptly handle various tech stacks, databases, CI/CD pipelines, SDKs, and CLIs, ensuring robust backend development and seamless integration with frontend designs.

In the realm of design, my expertise with Figma and a keen understanding of user experience elevate my ability to craft interfaces that are not only visually stunning but also highly intuitive and user-friendly. My design skills are further enhanced by my physics background, which provides a unique perspective on problem-solving and system design, allowing me to create solutions that are both innovative and practical.

Having contributed to both Web2 and Web3 projects, I am skilled in blockchain interactions, DApp development, and smart contract programming, making me adept at navigating the complexities of these emerging technologies. My work has been recognized in the ChainLink Hackathon and Ethereum Global Online, showcasing my ability to blend technical skills with creative design.

In summary, my profile is that of a versatile developer and designer, one who understands the intricacies of software engineering, appreciates the nuances of UI/UX design, and applies a scientific approach to problem-solving. This unique combination makes me particularly effective in creating responsive, cross-platform solutions that are not only functionally excellent but also aesthetically compelling and user-centric. My approach is to deliver comprehensive, end-to-end development and design services that meet the highest standards of quality and innovation.
